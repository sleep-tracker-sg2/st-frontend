//handles authentication Logout

/*
    In our lesson example, the logout was a click event similar to this.

    const logout = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        localStorage.removeItem('jwt');
        props.history.push()
    }


    This of course is removing a localstorage token.  Not sure how this would work
    with the backend.
